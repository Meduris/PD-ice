Fork of [PD ice](https://github.com/ndachel/PD-ice) on which I will probably test different things
=============
You will also find [here](https://github.com/Sarius997/PD-ice/blob/master/Tasks.md) a list of all the issues I recognized and what is already fixed. </br>
This fork is only for me being able to test everything.
